# Advent of Code 2021

Solving the advent calendar: https://adventofcode.com/2022

Let's see how far I get this year ..

To run individual solution for a day the command pattern is usually something
like this:

    ./day01.py input01.txt

To run tests and linting and other things just run:

    make
