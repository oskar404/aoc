# Advent of Code 2019

Solving the advent calendar: https://adventofcode.com/2019

To run individual solution for a day the command pattern is usually something
like this:

    ./day10.py input10.txt

Some of the solutions have self tests. These can be executed by running the
script without arguments. Some of the solutions have separate unittests. To run
these run:

    pytest

Never finished all of the puzzles, but got bit further than previous year ..
