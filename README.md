# Advent of Code 2020

Solving the advent calendar: https://adventofcode.com/2020

Let's see how far I get this year ..

To run individual solution for a day the command pattern is usually something
like this:

    ./day01.py input01.txt

Some of the solutions have self tests. These can be executed by running the
script without arguments. Some of the solutions have separate unittests. To run
these run:

    pytest
