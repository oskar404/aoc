# Advent of Code 2025

> The Elves have good news and bad news.
> 
> The good news is that they've discovered project management! This has given 
> them the tools they need to prevent their usual Christmas emergency. For 
> example, they now know that the North Pole decorations need to be finished 
> soon so that other critical tasks can start on time.
>
> The bad news is that they've realized they have a different emergency: 
> according to their resource planning, none of them have any time left to 
> decorate the North Pole!
